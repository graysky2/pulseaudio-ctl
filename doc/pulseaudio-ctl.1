.SH DESCRIPTION
Recommended usage of \fBpulseaudio-ctl\fP is to map a call to the script (see below) to a single keypress for easy access to change mute status or quickly adjust master volume levels. Many keyboards have keys specific to these particular actions and many if not all DE or WMs offer the ability to natively map a script call to a keypress or combo of key presses. For example, xfce4 allows for this under Settings > Keyboard > Applicaton Shortcuts.
